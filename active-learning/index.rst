I utilise active learning methods for all of my classes to maximise student outcomes. In particular, I employ *Online Challenge-Based Active Learning* (CBAL). Together with Assistant Professor Mika Tamura of the International Education Support Center for Engineering I have set up the ATLAS Initiative (Active Learning in STEM), of which CBAL is one integral part.

- Introduction to **Online Challenge-Based Active Learning**: My talk at the Active Learning Center at Kyushu University on the 26th of September, 2017 (`video`_, `slides`_).
- `Video-based instruction`_: My experience of experimenting with video-based instruction and the scalable-learning platform.
