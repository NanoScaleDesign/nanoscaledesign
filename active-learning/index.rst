I utilise active learning methods for all of my classes to maximise student outcomes. In particular, I employ *Online Challenge-Based Active Learning* (CBAL). Together with Assistant Professor Mika Tamura of the International Education Support Center for Engineering I have set up the ATLAS Initiative (Active Learning in STEM), of which CBAL is one integral part.

- `Online Challenge-Based Active Learning slides`_ from my talk at the Active Learning Center at Kyushu University on the 26th of September, 2017. The talk was in Japanese but most slides were written in English. A recording of the talk will be published during 2017.
- `Video-based instruction`_: My experience of experimenting with video-based instruction and the scalable-learning platform.
