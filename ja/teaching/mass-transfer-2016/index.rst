Mass Transfer 2016 (Spring semester)
====================================

As part of a 5-lecture course on mass transfer, during the first 2-3 lectures I experimented with a flipped-classroom approach using online videos that the students were required to watch prior to attending the class. I am releasing the 1st 7 videos below for general viewing, in the hope that they are useful for students beyond the 14 that attended the course here in Kyushu.

1. Defining a concentration gradient
------------------------------------

How to define a concentration gradient in terms of mass and molar density.

2. Fick's law
-------------

Defining Fick's law in terms of mass and molar density.

3. Defining a stationary medium
-------------------------------

Defining a stationary medium in terms of net system velocity and flux.

4. Diffusion coefficient equivalency
------------------------------------

The diffusion coefficient of each species in a mixture must be the same (assuming a stationary medium).

5. Bulk Velocity
----------------

Clarifying the meaning of "bulk velocity" in terms of mass and molar density.

6. Absolute vs Diffusive flux
-----------------------------

A demonstration through derivation of how absolute flux and diffusive flux are linked.

7. Conservation of species
--------------------------

Showing how the gradient of concentration inside a volume is linked to the rate of change of density inside
